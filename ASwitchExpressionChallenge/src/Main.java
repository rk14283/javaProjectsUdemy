//Day of the week challenge
//1. Create a method called printDayOfWeek, that takes as an int parameter called day, but
//doesn't return any values.
//  Use the enhanced switch statement, to return the name of the day, based on the parameter
//passed to the switch statement, so that 0 will return "Sunday", 1 will return "Monday",
//and so on. Any number not between 0 and 6, should return "Invalid Day".
// Use the enhanced switch statement as an expression, returning the result to a String named dayOfTheWeek
//Print both the day variable and the dayOfTheWeek variable

//2. In the main method, call this method for values 0 through 7.
//Bonus: Create a second method called printWeekDay, that uses an if then else statement, instead of a switch.
//to produce the same output.
